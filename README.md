# SnakeGame
A version of the Snake game written in Python. The player starts off with a small snake which grows longer as it "eats" food pellets that appear in random loacations on the game screen. 
The player's objective is to "eat" food pellets to increase their score and lengthen their snake while avoiding collisions with the walls and segments of the snake's tail.
